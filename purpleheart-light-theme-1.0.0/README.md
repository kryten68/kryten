## Purple Heart Theme for Visual Studio Code
This is my first attempt at making a theme for Visual Studio Code, but won't be my last.
This theme features a soothing Purple palette with minimal changes to syntax highlighting.

### TODO:
* Improve contrast
* Bring in another color, probably a very dark blue-purple.
* Assess usability then break the theme into several projects: light & dark
* Experiment more with syntax highlighting.

### For more information
Welcome to use it and play around with it. No guarantees though.

**Enjoy!**
